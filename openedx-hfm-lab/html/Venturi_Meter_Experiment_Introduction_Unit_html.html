			             <p align="justify">             The Venturi meter used in this experiment consists of successive converging, uniform and diverging sections equipped with pressure taps at selected locations. <br/> A Ventura meter is a device for determining the flow-rate of a fluid down a pipe. One measures the pressure difference between the venture inlet and neck, and from this the flow-rate can be determined.              </p>              <p>         <a href="http://eerc03-iiith.virtual-labs.ac.in/exp5/2.
