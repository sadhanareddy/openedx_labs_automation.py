			             <p align="justify">             The purpose of this experiment is to illustrate the influence of Reynolds number on pipe flows. Reynolds number is a very useful dimensionless quantity (the ratio of dynamic forces to viscous forces) that aids in classifying certain flows. For incompressible flow in a pipe Reynolds number based on the pipe diameter, ReD = VaveDĎ/Îź, serves well. Generally, laminar flows correspond to ReD &lt; 2100, transitional flows occur in the range 2100 &lt; ReD &lt; 4000, and turbulent flows exist for ReD &gt; 4000. However, disturbances in the flow from various sources may cause the flow to deviate from this pattern. This experiment will illustrate laminar, transitional, and turbulent flows in a pipe.              </p>               <p>         <a href="http://eerc03-iiith.virtual-labs.ac.in/exp10/7.Reynolds_experiment.pdf" target="_blank">Read More</a>         </p>
