			             <p align="justify">             Most of the hydraulics studies are based on the principle of Bernoulliâs theorem. Verification of above principle experimentally helps in better understanding of the principles of hydraulics flow. The theorem is based on the law of conservation of energy. According to the Bernoulliâs theorem in an ideal incompressible steady and continues flow, the sum of the pressure energy ,potential energy, and the kinematic energy per unit weight of the fluid is constant.             </p> <br/>         <p>            <a href="http://eerc03-iiith.virtual-labs.ac.in/exp1/1.Bernoullis_experiment.pdf" target="_blank">Read More</a>         </p>
