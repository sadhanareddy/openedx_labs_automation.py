		           <p align="justify">          Pelton turbine is a high head impulse turbine. It is used for high head and low flow rate applications. Single jet Pelton turbines are built for specific speeds less than 35. The input pressure head is converted into high velocity jet by means of a nozzle. The jet impinges on the double cupped buckets mounted around the periphery of the runner disc, making the runner to rotate. The flow through the runner is at atmospheric pressure. Hence, the turbines are called constant pressure turbines.            </p>                         <p>         <a href="http://eerc03-iiith.virtual-labs.ac.in/exp13/10.Turbines.pdf" target="_blank">Read More</a>         </p>
