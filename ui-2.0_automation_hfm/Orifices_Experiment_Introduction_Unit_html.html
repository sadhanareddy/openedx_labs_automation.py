			             <p align="justify">             An orifice is an opening in the side or bottom of a vessel or a tank, through which the liquid will flow under the condition that the liquid surface is always above the top edge of the opening. The orifices are used for the measurement of flow of liquids. The measurement of flow depends on the velocity of flow liquid and the form in which liquid d flows.               </p>              <p align="justify">            In an orifice the liquid flows in the form of a jet caused by the opening of the orifice, and the velocity of flow is caused due to conversion of pressure energy of liquid in to kinetic energy.              </p>             <p>         <a href="http://eerc03-iiith.virtual-labs.ac.in/exp6/3.Orifices.pdf" target="_blank">Read More</a>         </p>
