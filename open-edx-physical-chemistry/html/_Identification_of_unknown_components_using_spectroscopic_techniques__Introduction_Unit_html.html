			             <p> Principle behind all spectroscopic techniques is that under certain  conditions, materials absorb or emit energy . Different spectroscopic techniques work over different ranges of frequency depending on the processes and magnitudes of the energy changes.<br/><br/> Electromagentic radiation: microwave, Infra Red, Visible and Ultaviolet, X-ray and gamma rays spectroscopy.<br/> Acoustic spectrscopy<br/> Other mechanical methods.</p>
