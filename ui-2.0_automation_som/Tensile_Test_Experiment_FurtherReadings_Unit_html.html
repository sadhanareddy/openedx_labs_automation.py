		 	    <p> 	      Procedure for the experiment is as follows. 	    </p> <p align="justify"> 1. The load pointer is set at zero by adjusting the initial the initial setting mode. <br/> 2. The dial gauge is fixed for measuring elongation of small amounts.<br/> 3. Measure the diameter of the test piece with the help of a vernier calliper at least at three pieces and determine the mean value. Also mark the gauge length.<br/> 4.  Now the specimen is gripped between the upper and middle cross head jaws of the machine.<br/> 5. Start the machine and the specimen is gradually loaded. Note down the load and its corresponding dial gauge reading. The observations are taken until the  specimen breaks<br/> 6. Plot the graph between stress vs. strain.</p>  <p>         <a href="Exp-1 Tension Test.pdf" target="_blank">Read More</a>         </p>
