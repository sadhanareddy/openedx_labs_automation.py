<p align="justify">           Beams placed on more than 2 supports are called continuous beams. Continuous beams are used when the span of the beam is very large, deflection under each rigid support will be equal zero.<br/>   BMD for Continuous beams: <br/>  BMD for continuous beams can be obtained by superimposing the fixed end moments diagram over the free bending moment diagram. <br/>  Three - moment Equation for continuous beams THREE MOMENT EQUATION             </p> <p> <a href="http://bsa-iiith.virtual-labs.ac.in/exp3/Exp-3 Continuous Beams.pdf" target="_blank">Read More</a> </p>
