			             <p> Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the powerful analytical techniques used in determining the structure of organic compounds. Isotopes of 1H, 13C, 19F and 31P have I = Â˝ and of great interest. 1H NMR or the proton NMR is the technique in which the hydrogen nuclei of the compound/substance is studied in order to determine the structure of the compound under study. The two most characteristic of  a NMR spectra are the chemical shift and the coupling constant. This experiment deals with virtually recording the proton NMR spectra for a set of samples and analyzing them. </p><p>  </p><center><img src="./images/figure1_intro.png" style="width:599px; height:397px;"/></center><p></p><p>
