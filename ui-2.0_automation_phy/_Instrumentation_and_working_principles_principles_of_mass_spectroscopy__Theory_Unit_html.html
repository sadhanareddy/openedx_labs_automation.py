When the ions pass through the two poles of a magent, the charged particles take a curve path. The radius of curvature (r) of this path is:<br/>  </p><center><img src="http://ccnsb06-iiith.vlabs.ac.in/exp8/images/eq21.png" style="width:93px; height:49px;"/></center><p></p><p><br/> where B is the magnetic field strength.<br/> Combining the above two equations:<br/> </p><center><img src="http://ccnsb06-iiith.vlabs.ac.in/exp8/images/eq31.png" style="width:129px; height:63px;"/></center><p></p><p><br/> Greater the value of m/z value larger is the radius of the curved path. The analyser tube has a fixed radius of curvature and the magnetic field strength is varied such that all the ions reach the detector. <br/><br/>  The mass spectrometer consist of five important componenets:<br/>   a. Sample inlet: Here the sample under study is introduced into the chamber and the pressure inside the sample inlet is much lower than the outside pressure. A stream of molecules is produced here.<br/> b. Ion Source: The stream of molecules undergo ionisation by various methods. Different compounds are ionised by different methods. This includes: Electron Ionisation(EI), Chemical Ionisation (CI), Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), Fast Atom Bombardment (FAB) and Matrix Desorption Ionisation (MALDI)<br/> c. Mass Analyser: Saparates the compound based on their mass to charge ratio (m/z). <br/> d. Detector: The ions that are deflected under the magnetic field are detected by the detector.<br/> e. Output: The siganl is then recorded and processed by the data system. The output is the mass spectrum.<br/>  </p><center><img src="http://ccnsb06-iiith.vlabs.ac.in/exp8/images/figure2_intro_exp8.jpg" style="width:375px; height:375px;"/></center><p></p><p><br/>  Picture source: <a href="http://web.mit.edu/12.000/www/finalpresentation/experiments/gcms.html">http://web.mit.edu/12.000/www/finalpresentation/experiments/gcms.html</a><br/><br/>  Ionsiation methods and the source of ionisation:<br/> </p><center> <table border="1" cellpadding="5"> <tbody><tr> <td><b>Ionisation source</b></td> <td><b>Ionisation method</b></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Electrospray Ionisation (ESI)</td> <td>Evapouration of charged droplets</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Nano Electrospray Ionisation (nanoESI)</td> <td>Evapouration of charged droplets</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Chemical Ionisation (CI)</td> <td>Proton transfer</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionisation (APCI)</td> <td>Corona discharge and proton transfer</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionisation (MALDI)</td> <td>Proton absorption/ proton transfer</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Desorption/Ionisation  On Silicon (DIOS)</td> <td>Proton absorption/ proton transfer</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Fast Atom/Ion Bombardment (FAB)</td> <td>Ion desorption/ proton transfer</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Electron Ionisation (EI)</td> <td>Electron beam/ electron transfer</td> </tr> </tbody></table> </center><p></p><p><br/>  <b>Electron Ionisation method: </b><br/> In all the mass spectrometers regardsless of the method used to determine the mass-to-charge ratio of a molecule/compound, first the sample has to enter the mass spectrometer, then converted to charge particle by ion source before there are deflected by the magnetic field and detected. In EI-MS a beam of high energy electrons stike the incoming molecules. The electron and the molecules collide and the molecules form cationss. A repleeer plate that carries a positive electrical potential directs the newly created ions towards a series of accelaration plates. A large potetial difference (1 to 10 KV) is applied across these plates to produce a beam of positive ions. There is a repeller plate that absorbs any negative ions. Molecules that are not ionised are drwan off by the vacuum. Most of the molecules or atoms require 8 to 15 electron colts to get ionised. But usually the beam of electrons stike the molecules at 50 to 70 eV. For recording a simple proton NMR spectra deuterated solvents especially for the use of NMR are used.<br/><br/>  Salient features of EI method:<br/> 1.      Basic and well understood ionisation method<br/> 2.      Ideal for all volatile compounds with masses less than 1000.<br/> 3.      Leads to molecular ion fragmentation, fragmentation provides structural information.<br/> 4.      Mass spectra are reproducible.<br/>    <!--When a nuclei of I=1/2 is placed in a magnetic field and is subjected to radiofrequency (RF) radiation of a particular frequency, nuclei absorbs the energy. The frequency at which this absorption takes place depends on: the characteristic of the nucleus, whether it is 1H, 13C, 19F and 31P, their chemical environment and on spatial location in the the magnetic field if that field is not everywhere uniform <br/> For recording a simple proton NMR spectra deuterated solvents especially for the use of NMR are used.<br> <center><img src="./images/image3.png" /></center></p><p><br><br> <h2><b>What does NMR Spectra tell you:</b></h2><br> <p>1)A low resolution NMR spectrum <br>      a)The number of peaks corresponds to the number of different hydrogen environment.<br>      b)The ratio of the areas under the peaks gives the ratio of the numbers of hydrogen atoms in each of these environments<br>      c)The chemical shifts give the information of type of hydrogen atoms present.<br><br>    2)High Resolution NMR Spectra<br>      The single peak in the low resolution spectrum splits into clusters of peaks The amount of splitting tells you about the number of hydrogens attached to the carbon atom or the neighboring  atoms.
